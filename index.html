  <h1>Welcome to the BettaCraft SMP Official Website</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>BettaCraft SMP is a private, whitelisted Minecraft server for content creators. We are a long-running SMP, meaning we spend more than a year in the same world before moving on to a new one. Each season brings new ideas, new base themes and stories waiting to be told. We tend to have our own big bases and incorporate them into 1 big integrated world.</p>
    <p>We have different districts on the server such as the Shopping district where we sell items for diamonds, and a minigames district for games. We don't really have server wide lore but some of our bases do have hidden lore to discover and figure out. If you have any questions you can always ask AJ Zoomer on his socials and in his discord server or ask another member about BettaCraft SMP</p>
